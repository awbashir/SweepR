# SweepR

SweepR (`sweepr`) is an IPv4/IPv6 network scanner for macOS and Linux, built for enterprise
networks. It combines LanScan-style live discovery with IEEE 802.1Q VLAN scanning and
switch / firewall / access-point discovery over CDP and LLDP.

The `sweepr` binary has two front-ends that share one Rust engine (`sweepr_core`):

- **CLI**: run it with a subcommand (`sweepr scan ...`). It scans in the terminal and exits.
- **GUI**: run it with no arguments, with `--gui`, or open the `.app`. This starts the Tauri
  desktop app.

## What it does

- **Interfaces**: finds every interface and labels it Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 802.1Q
  sub-interface (`vlan0`, `en0.100`, `eth0.10`), VPN, bridge/virtual or loopback. The
  default-route interface is marked.
- **Local IPv4 discovery**: sends broadcast ARP over the interface's connected subnet. Sending
  is rate-limited (`--rate-pps`), unanswered addresses get extra passes (`--retries`), and
  each result shows up as soon as it is found.
- **VLAN scanning**: sends 802.1Q-tagged ARP for one or more VLANs (`--vlan 10,20,30`,
  `--vlan 1-100`, or `--vlan untagged,10,20` to include the native network). Tagged replies
  are matched back to their VLAN. If the OS already has a VLAN sub-interface for an ID,
  SweepR scans through that sub-interface instead. Wi-Fi generally does not carry tagged
  frames; SweepR warns when tagged probing is requested on a Wi-Fi interface.
- **VLAN discovery**: listens passively for 802.1Q tags, Cisco VTP (VLAN names) and DTP
  (trunk negotiation). It also lists the OS's VLAN sub-interfaces. `--vlan auto` combines
  both sources.
- **Infrastructure discovery**: decodes CDP and LLDP to report device name, platform/model,
  OS version, remote port, management IPs, native and voice VLANs (including LLDP-MED
  network policy), and capabilities. A device that matches a neighbor is labelled as a
  Switch, Router, Access Point or Firewall.
- **Routed ranges**: addresses outside the connected subnet get an async ICMP echo sweep,
  then MAC addresses are filled in from the OS neighbor cache (only for hosts that answered,
  or entries the sweep itself created; stale cache entries are ignored).
- **IPv6** (`-6`): sends an ICMPv6 echo to `ff02::1` from the link-local address and from
  every global / unique-local address of the interface, sends neighbor solicitations for the
  EUI-64 addresses of hosts that answered ARP, and listens for neighbor and router
  advertisements. IPv6 addresses are attached to the matching IPv4 host as extra IPs
  ("Other IPs" column).
- **Export**: live terminal table, JSON, CSV or XLSX. Text learned from the network is
  stripped of control/escape characters, and CSV cells that a spreadsheet would treat as
  formulas are prefixed with `'`.

- **Enrichment**: after discovery, resolved hosts are enriched: the IEEE OUI database
  (embedded) names the vendor, DNS PTR / mDNS / NetBIOS fill host names, a bounded TCP
  connect scan (`-p`) lists open ports, and a management-port fingerprint classifies gear
  when nothing better is known. Name resolution is on by default (`--no-resolve` disables
  it).
- **SNMP** (`--snmp-community`, or the `sweepr snmp <IP>` subcommand): polls the system MIB,
  VLAN tables (Q-BRIDGE and Cisco VTP) and the bridge / CAM tables (v1 GETNEXT, v2c/v3
  GETBULK) to classify infrastructure by role and map endpoint MACs to named switch ports
  (`Gi1/0/24`). Walks are bounded (row caps, per-device deadline, end-of-MIB / loop
  detection) so a hostile agent cannot hang or exhaust memory.

## CLI usage

```sh
# Scan the default interface's subnet (live table)
sudo sweepr scan

# Scan a range
sweepr scan --range 10.0.0.0/24

# Probe VLANs 10, 20, 30 with tagged ARP and listen for CDP/LLDP
sudo sweepr scan -i en0 -r 10.177.134.1-10.177.140.254 --vlan 10,20,30 --snmp-community public --cdp-lldp

# Listen passively on a trunk for VLANs and CDP/LLDP neighbors
sudo sweepr vlans -i en0 --timeout 30

# Poll one switch over SNMP: system info, VLAN table and MAC-to-port table
sweepr snmp 10.0.0.1 --snmp-community public
sweepr snmp 10.0.0.1 --snmp-community public -o json

# Include IPv6 neighbors and export to Excel
sudo sweepr scan -r 192.168.1.0/24 -6 -o xlsx -f devices.xlsx

# JSON / CSV go to stdout unless --file is given
sweepr scan -r 10.0.0.0/24 -o json > devices.json

# List interfaces (kind, VLAN ID/parent, addresses)
sweepr interfaces
```

Main `scan` flags:

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `-i, --interface` | Interface to use. Defaults to the default-route interface. |
| `-r, --range` | Targets as `10.0.0.0/24`, `10.0.0.1-10.0.3.254`, `10.0.0.1-50` or a comma list. Defaults to the interface's subnet. |
| `--vlan <IDS>` | 802.1Q VLAN IDs: `10,20,30`, `1-100`, `untagged,10,20` or `auto`. |
| `--discover-vlans` | Sniff 802.1Q tags, VTP and DTP while scanning. |
| `--cdp-lldp` | Listen for CDP/LLDP advertisements while scanning. |
| `--snmp-community` | SNMP v2c community. Enables SNMP infrastructure polling. |
| `-6, --ipv6` | IPv6 neighbor discovery. |
| `-p, --ports` | TCP ports to connect-scan, e.g. `22,80,443` or `1-1024`. |
| `--no-resolve` | Disable DNS / mDNS / NetBIOS name resolution. |
| `-o, --output` | `table` (default, live), `json`, `csv` or `xlsx`. |
| `-f, --file` | Output file. Required for `xlsx`. |
| `--timeout-ms`, `--rate-pps`, `--retries`, `--listen-secs`, `--concurrency` | Timing and pacing (validated: timeout <= 600000 ms, rate 1-1000000 pps, retries <= 10, listen <= 86400 s, concurrency 1-65535). |

Press Ctrl-C once to stop and still get the results found so far. Press it twice to abort.
Piping into a reader that exits early (`sweepr scan | head -1`) stops the scan quietly with
exit status 0. If the OS transmit queue fills up (ENOBUFS), SweepR backs off and slows down
instead of failing, and reports how many probe frames were dropped.
Set `RUST_LOG=debug` for diagnostic logging.

## Privileges

Raw frames (ARP, 802.1Q tags, NDP) and passive capture (CDP, LLDP, VTP, DTP) need raw
packet access.

- **Linux**: run with `sudo`, or give the binary capabilities:
  `sudo setcap cap_net_raw,cap_net_admin=eip ./sweepr`.
- **macOS**: run with `sudo`. Giving your user access to `/dev/bpf*` (for example with
  Wireshark's *ChmodBPF* launch daemon) is enough for passive capture, but recent macOS
  versions hide interface MAC addresses from unprivileged processes (`sweepr interfaces`
  then shows no MACs and says so), and active ARP/802.1Q/NDP probes need the real MAC, so
  active layer-2 scans require `sudo`.

Without these privileges SweepR does not stop. It prints a warning and falls back to an
unprivileged ICMP sweep plus the OS neighbor cache, so hosts that block ICMP can be missed.
Tagged VLAN probing, IPv6 NDP and passive listening are skipped. Routed ranges always use
ICMP. On Linux, unprivileged ICMP needs `net.ipv4.ping_group_range` to include your group.

The NIC and driver must pass 802.1Q tags through for tagged scanning and tag discovery to
work. Capture is promiscuous, and libpcap re-inserts tags that Linux moves into packet
metadata. Some NICs, especially on macOS, still strip tags in hardware.

## Building

You need:

- Rust 1.90 or newer (`rustup`); this is the MSRV of Tauri 2.12 and its plugins
- libpcap: ships with macOS. On Debian/Ubuntu, install `libpcap-dev`.
- Tauri v2 system dependencies on Linux: `libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev`, `libgtk-3-dev`,
  `librsvg2-dev`, `libayatana-appindicator3-dev`
- Node.js 20 or newer for the React frontend

```sh
# CLI / engine only (the frontend is not needed for cargo builds)
cd src-tauri
cargo build --release
./target/release/sweepr --help

# Tests and lints
cargo test
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Desktop app (from the repository root)
npm install
npm run tauri:dev      # development
npm run tauri:build    # .app/.dmg (macOS), .deb/.AppImage (Linux)
```

## GUI backend contract

The webview may call only the commands listed in `src-tauri/build.rs` and granted in
`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json` (Tauri ACL):

| Command | Arguments | Returns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `list_interfaces` | none | `InterfaceInfo[]` |
| `start_scan` | `{ config: ScanConfig }` | `scanId` (number). Cancels any running job. |
| `start_vlan_discovery` | `{ interface?: string, timeoutSecs?: number }` | `scanId` (number). Cancels any running job. |
| `stop_scan` | `{ scanId?: number }` | `true` if a job was signalled. With `scanId`, only that job is stopped. |
| `export_devices` | `{ devices: Device[], format: "csv" \| "json" \| "xlsx" }` | The written path, or `null` if the user cancelled. |
| `load_overrides` | none | `Record<string, DeviceOverride>` (may be empty). |
| `save_override` | `{ key: string, hostname: string \| null, comments: string \| null }` | `null`. Rejects on a write error. |
| `scan_ports` | `{ ip: string, ports: number[] }` | `number[]` of open ports (sorted). Rejects on a bad IP or > 4096 ports. |
| `query_snmp` | `{ ip: string, snmp: SnmpConfig \| null }` | `SnmpDeviceInfo`. Rejects on a bad IP, invalid config or unreachable device. |

Tauri maps Rust snake_case command arguments to camelCase in JS automatically (so
`scan_id` is `scanId`, `timeout_secs` is `timeoutSecs`).

`export_devices` opens the native save dialog from the backend. The webview never passes a
file path. The chosen file must have the format's extension (it is added when missing), and
symbolic links and non-regular files are refused.

`save_override` persists one record to a JSON file under the OS application-data directory
(atomic temp-file + rename). Strings are sanitized and capped at 1024 characters; sending
`null` (or a whitespace-only string) for a field clears it, and clearing both removes the
entry. `load_overrides` returns the whole store, keyed by a device's `ip` (plus `@vlanId`
when the device has a VLAN) — the same key the engine applies overrides by, filling a
device's `hostname` / `comments` on emitted snapshots when they are otherwise empty.

`scan_ports` and `query_snmp` are single-device helpers for the details drawer; they run
independently of any scan job and do not emit `scan-event`s.

The webview may open `http`, `https`, `mailto` and `tel` URLs via the opener plugin
(`opener:default`), plus `ssh://` and `telnet://` (a tight `opener:allow-open-url` scope);
any other scheme is denied.

Scan progress arrives on the Tauri event `scan-event`. Every payload is wrapped with the id
of the job that produced it:

```json
{ "scanId": 7, "event": { "type": "device", "data": { "ip": "10.0.0.5", "...": "..." } } }
```

- `event` has the same `{ type, data }` shape as the CLI JSON events (`device`, `vlan`,
  `neighbor`, `port_mapping`, `progress`, `log`, `finished`).
- Only the current job emits. Once a new `start_scan` / `start_vlan_discovery` supersedes a
  job, that job emits nothing more, including its `finished`. The frontend should still
  ignore any payload whose `scanId` is not the id returned by its latest start call.
- A stopped (not superseded) job still sends its remaining events and ends with `finished`
  (`cancelled: true`).
- `device` and `vlan` events are full, merged snapshots: replace the row with the same key
  (device: `ip` plus `vlanId`; VLAN: `id`). `neighbor` events are sent when a neighbor is
  new or its advertisement changed.
- `port_mapping` events (`{ type: "port_mapping", data: SwitchPortMapping }`) carry one
  SNMP-learned MAC→switch-port entry. The backend already applies each mapping to the
  matching device row (setting `switchPort`) and re-emits that `device`; the raw
  `port_mapping` events are also forwarded for callers that want the full CAM table.
- `progress` events report one combined `probesSent / probesTotal` for the whole scan. Both
  values only grow. After discovery the scan runs an enrichment phase
  (`progress.phase === "enriching"`) that streams further `device`, `vlan` and
  `port_mapping` snapshots as names, ports, vendors and SNMP data arrive.

### New / enrichment data shapes

The engine fills these fields on `Device` during enrichment: `vendor` (IEEE OUI lookup),
`dnsName`, `mdnsName`, `smbName`, `smbDomain`, `openPorts` and `switchPort`. The command and
event payloads use these TypeScript-style shapes (all camelCase):

```ts
interface SwitchPortMapping {
  switchName: string;
  switchIp: string | null;
  portName: string;      // e.g. "Gi1/0/24"
  portIndex: number | null;
  vlanId: number | null;
  mac: string;
}

interface DeviceOverride {
  hostname: string | null;
  comments: string | null;
}

interface PortMacCount {
  portName: string;
  portIndex: number | null;
  macCount: number;      // high counts flag uplink / trunk ports
}

interface SnmpDeviceInfo {
  sysName: string | null;
  sysDescr: string | null;
  sysUptimeTicks: number | null;   // hundredths of a second
  sysObjectId: string | null;
  role: "switch" | "firewall" | "access_point" | "router" | "host"; // never null
  vlans: VlanInfo[];
  portMappings: SwitchPortMapping[];
  portMacCounts: PortMacCount[];
}

// Passed to query_snmp (and nested in ScanConfig.snmp). Omitted fields default
// (v2c / "public" / port 161 / 2000 ms / 1 retry).
interface SnmpConfig {
  version: "v1" | "v2c" | "v3";
  community: string;
  v3: {
    username: string;
    authProtocol: "md5" | "sha1" | "sha224" | "sha256" | "sha384" | "sha512";
    authPassword: string | null;
    privProtocol: "des" | "aes128" | "aes192" | "aes256";
    privPassword: string | null;
  } | null;
  port: number;
  timeoutMs: number;
  retries: number;
}
```
